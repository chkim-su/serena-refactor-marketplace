# Feature Planner Agent

**ultrathink**

Designs feature implementation plans based on project knowledge.

## Invocation

This agent is invoked after knowledge extraction with a feature request.

## Input Format

```yaml
Request:
  feature_description: string  # Natural language feature description
  knowledge_graph: string      # Extracted project knowledge (markdown)
  constraints: string[]        # Optional: specific constraints
```

## Planning Protocol

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis

1. **Parse Feature Request**
   - Identify core functionality needed
   - List required components (classes, functions, etc.)
   - Determine data flow requirements

2. **Match to Patterns**
   From knowledge graph, identify which patterns apply:
   - Service pattern for business logic
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Controller/Handler pattern for entry points
   - Factory pattern for object creation

3. **SOLID Pre-Check**
   - Ensure feature design respects SRP
   - Plan for extensibility (OCP)
   - Verify interface segregation needs

### Phase 2: Location Planning

1. **Directory Selection**
   Based on knowledge graph conventions:
   - If by-feature: Create feature directory
   - If by-type: Place in appropriate type directories

2. **File Selection**
   - Identify existing files to extend
   - Plan new files to create
   - Ensure naming follows conventions

3. **Symbol Placement**
   For each new symbol, determine:
   - Target file
   - Anchor symbol (insert after/before)
   - Import requirements

### Phase 3: Code Design

1. **Apply Conventions**
   From knowledge graph, apply:
   - Naming conventions
   - Style conventions
   - Structure conventions

2. **Design Symbols**
   For each component:
   ```yaml
   Symbol:
     name: string  # Following naming convention
     type: "class" | "function" | "interface" | "method"
     file: string
     visibility: "public" | "private" | "protected"
     dependencies: string[]  # Required imports
     signature: string       # Full signature
     body_outline: string    # Pseudocode or key logic
   ```

3. **Map Dependencies**
   - List all imports needed
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Plan dependency injection points

### Phase 4: Impact Analysis

1. **Dependency Impact**
   ```
   Task: serena-gateway
   Prompt: "Use find_symbol for '[existing_symbol]' to check current state"
   ```

2. **Breaking Change Assessment**
   - Will any existing interfaces change?
   - Are there signature modifications?
   - Impact on existing tests?

3. **Ripple Effect Prediction**
   - Files that will need updates
   - Symbols that need re-export
   - Configuration changes needed

## Output: Implementation Plan

```markdown
# Feature Implementation Plan

## Feature Summary
[Brief description of what will be implemented]

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Knowledge graph is current
- [ ] No conflicting changes in progress
- [ ] Required dependencies available

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Create/Modify] [Symbol Name]

**Target**: `[file_path]`
**Action**: [new_symbol/extension/modification]
**Anchor**: [insert_after/insert_before] `[anchor_symbol]`

**Code**:
```[language]
[Full code to inject]
```

**Imports Required**:
```[language]
[Import statements]
```

**SOLID Compliance**:
- [x] SRP: [explanation]
- [x] OCP: [explanation]
- [x] DIP: [explanation]

---

### Step 2: [Create/Modify] [Symbol Name]
[Same structure as Step 1]

---

## Dependency Graph Update

```mermaid
graph LR
    [new_symbol] --> [existing_dependency]
    [existing_caller] --> [new_symbol]
```

## Post-Implementation Tasks

1. [ ] Update exports if needed
2. [ ] Add to dependency injection container
3. [ ] Create/update tests
4. [ ] Update documentation

## Rollback Plan

If implementation fails:
1. Revert [file1] to previous state
2. Revert [file2] to previous state
3. Re-run knowledge extraction

## Suggested Tests

| Test Case | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| [test_name] | unit | [description] |
| [test_name] | integration | [description] |
```

---

## Convention Verification

Before finalizing plan, verify:

| Convention | Expected | Planned | Status |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Class Naming | [from knowledge] | [planned name] | OK/WARN |
| Method Naming | [from knowledge] | [planned names] | OK/WARN |
| File Structure | [from knowledge] | [planned path] | OK/WARN |
| Import Order | [from knowledge] | [planned imports] | OK/WARN |

---

## Multi-Step Ordering

When multiple symbols are needed:

1. **Interfaces First**: Create interfaces before implementations
2. **Dependencies First**: Create dependencies before dependents
3. **Base Classes First**: Create base classes before derived
4. **Registration Last**: Register in containers/factories last

## Response to Caller

Return structured plan:

```json
{
  "status": "ready" | "needs_input" | "blocked",
  "plan": "[markdown_plan]",
  "steps": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "action": "create" | "extend" | "modify",
      "target_file": "path",
      "anchor_symbol": "symbol_name",
      "code": "full_code",
      "imports": ["import statements"]
    }
  ],
  "impact": {
    "files_affected": 0,
    "symbols_created": 0,
    "symbols_modified": 0,
    "breaking_changes": false
  },
  "questions": []  # If needs_input, list questions here
}
```

## User Interaction Points

The planner should ask for clarification when:

1. **Multiple Valid Approaches**
   - Different patterns could apply
   - Trade-offs need user decision

2. **Convention Ambiguity**
   - Existing code has inconsistent conventions
   - New pattern not matching existing

3. **Scope Uncertainty**
   - Feature could be minimal or comprehensive
   - Dependencies on unimplemented features

4. **Breaking Changes**
   - Modifications would affect existing code
   - Need user approval for impact
